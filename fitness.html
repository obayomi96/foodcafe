                            <ol>
<li><b>Beet juice for stamina</b></li>
<p>
Recent research shows that this ruby red root veggie may be more effective at boosting energy than caffeine, or nearly anything you'll find in the supplement aisle. When UK researchers asked male athletes to down either 16 ounces of organic beetroot juice or a placebo, those who gulped the real thing cycled for up to 16% longer, an effect scientists say isn't achievable by any other known means, including training. To bolster your performance, invest in a juicer and grab some fresh beets, which are in season year-round. Or look for bottled beet juice, which can be sipped straight or blended into a pre-workout smoothie.
</p>



<li><b>Honey for endurance</b></li>
<p>
Research conducted at the University of Memphis Exercise and Sport Nutrition Laboratory found that consuming honey before exercise provides "time-released" fuel to give athletes steady blood sugar and insulin levels over a longer duration. This natural sweetener also boosted power, speed, and endurance in competitive cyclists who downed it prior to and at 10-mile intervals throughout a 40-mile race. For quality and purity, I recommend USDA Certified Organic raw honey. Enjoy it straight off a spoon, or mix it into a pre-workout snack like oatmeal.
</p>




<li><b>Pea protein to delay muscle fatigue</b></li>
<p>
Pea protein powder has been generating serious buzz in the sports nutrition community for some time now. The reason: it's rich in branched chain amino acids, compounds that have been shown to delay fatigue during exercise. The arginine in this powder (which is made from yellow peas) has also been shown to enhance immunity, while the lysine boosts calcium absorption and decreases calcium losses to help maintain strong bones. One scoop can pack more than 25 grams of lean protein, which can be whipped into a smoothie along with almond milk, a dollop of almond butter, cinnamon, and frozen cherries or berries.
</p>




<li><b>Blueberries to reduce inflammation</b></li>
<p>
To test the anti-inflammatory and recovery effects of blueberries, researchers at Appalachian State University recruited well-trained athletes and fed them about 9 ounces of blueberries daily for six weeks, plus another 13 ounces an hour before a two-and a-half-hour run. The results were impressive. In addition to a reduction in inflammation, blueberry eaters experienced a boost in natural killer cells, a type of white blood cell that plays a vital role in immunity. When fresh blueberries aren't practical, reach for dried or freeze dried options to stash in your gym bag.
</p>


<li><b>Tart cherries to fight pain and regain strength</b></li>
<p>
At the University of Vermont's Human Performance Laboratory, researchers asked men to drink either 12 ounces of a tart cherry juice blend or a placebo twice daily for eight days. On the fourth day of the study, the athletes completed a strenuous strength-training routine. Two weeks later, the opposite beverage was provided, and the training was repeated. Scientists found that the cherry juice had a significant effect on pain reduction. In addition, strength loss averaged 22% in the placebo group compared to just 4% in the cherry group. Fresh tart cherries are only in season in late summer, but frozen and dried options are becoming easier to find, as is 100% tart cherry juice.
</p>



<li><b>Salmon to build muscle</b></li>
<p>
The omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish like salmon have been linked to a laundry list of benefits, from fighting heart disease to staving off type 2 diabetes. But animal research shows it may also be a potent muscle booster. Compared to steers fed cottonseed and olive oils, those that consumed fish oil showed improved muscle development: their bodies used twice the amount of amino acids to build new protein tissues, especially skeletal muscles. Include wild salmon in meals a few times a week, or try salmon jerky as a portable snack. If you can't or don't eat seafood, look for an algae-based source of omega-3s.
</p>



<li><b>Watermelon to reduce muscle soreness</b></li>
<p>
Recently, Spanish sports medicine scientists discovered that watermelon juice helped relieve muscle soreness when about 16 ounces were consumed an hour before exercise. The effect is likely due to citrulline, a natural substance found in watermelon that's been tied to improved artery function and lowered blood pressure (it's even been dubbed "nature’s Viagra"). I'm starting to see bottled watermelon juice popping up all over the place. And when you eat it fresh, be sure to bite into the white rind a bit—that's where citrulline is found in higher concentrations.
</p>


<li><b>Pomegranate for muscle strength recovery</b></li>
<p>
The antioxidants in pomegranate have been linked to enhanced memory and brain activity, and now researchers at the University of Texas at Austin report that pomegranate juice helps improve muscle recovery. Researchers recruited volunteers who were randomly assigned to maintain their normal diets and add 4 ounces of either pomegranate juice or a placebo twice a day. Both groups performed resistance-training exercises, but those who gulped pom experienced significantly less muscle soreness and reduced muscle weakness for up to 7 days. Pomegranate is a winter fruit, but you can find frozen options year-round. Just thaw and add to oatmeal, parfaits, or garden salads. Small shots of 100% juice are also a good option.
</p>



<li><b>Coffee for next-day energy</b></li>
<p>
A recent study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that glycogen, the body's storage form of carbohydrates, is replenished more rapidly when athletes consume both carbs and caffeine following exhaustive exercise. Compared to carbs alone, the combo resulted in a 66% increase in muscle glycogen 4 hours after intense exercise. That's significant because packing more fuel into the energy "piggy banks" within your muscles means that the next time you train or perform, you’ve upped your ability to exercise harder or longer. 
</p>



<li><b>Watercress to reduce DNA damage</b></li>
<p>
A recent study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that watercress, a peppery green from the mustard family, effectively countered the "wear and tear" effects of exercise. Healthy young men were given about 3 ounces of watercress daily for eight weeks, and asked to participate in treadmill workouts that included short bursts of intense exercise. Another exercise group did the workouts without watercress as a control. The men who missed out on watercress experienced more exercise-induced DNA damage, and the benefits were seen after just one dose. In other words, those who ate the green for the first time just two hours before hitting the treadmill experienced the same benefits as those who had munched on it daily for two months. Watercress makes a wonderful salad base and, like spinach and kale, it can be whipped into a smoothie.
</p>



<li><b>Dark chocolate to curb exercise-induced stress</b></li>
<p>
Numerous studies support the myriad benefits of dark chocolate and new research published in the European Journal of Nutrition adds exercise protection to the list. In the study, healthy men were asked to eat 3.5 ounces of 70% dark chocolate two hours before a two-and-a-half-hour bout of cycling. Compared to a control group, the chocolate eaters experienced higher blood antioxidant levels and reduced markers of exercise-induced cell stress. Enjoy a few individually wrapped squares of dark chocolate daily, melt and drizzle it over fresh fruit, or mix it into oatmeal, smoothies, or parfaits. 
</p>


<li><b>The Power of Protein</b></li>
<p>
Eating properly for strength training means choosing high-quality protein sources and eating them at the optimal times. Unlike carbohydrates and fat, protein is not a primary energy source, but it plays an important role in metabolism and muscle health. Carbohydrates, fat, and protein work together to keep the body performing at its best. The goal of proper protein intake is to consume adequate amounts throughout the day, with extra doses after workouts. Eating protein after a strength workout?lifting weights or resistance training?helps restore the muscle tissues you’ve stressed during that workout. Over time, that combination builds strength and lean body mass. Instead of turning to supplements, get the majority of your protein from foods?your body will benefit from a well-rounded nutrient package of vitamins and minerals that come with those foods.
</p>



 <li><b>Lean Beef</b></li>
<p>
Lean beef is an ideal source of protein, and stir-frying is a quick and easy cooking method. Healthy carbohydrates from rice, and fiber from fresh veggies make for a well rounded meal after a strength workout. Consuming 20 to 30 grams post-exercise is plenty, and this recipe puts you right in that zone with 24.4 grams.
</p>



 <li><b>Eggs and Egg Whites</b></li>
<p>
Eggs have it all. They're one of the highest-quality protein sources around, because they contain all the necessary amino acid building blocks for healthy muscles. Have an omelet for breakfast, lunch, or dinner with 100 percent whole-grain toast for a satisfying meal that provides about 25 grams of protein and about 15 percent of your daily fiber needs. If you’re watching your dietary cholesterol intakes, you can make it with just egg whites.
</p>



<li><b>Protein-Rich Soy</b></li>
<p>
Tofu makes a filling and tasty meal! This vegetarian protein source is full of heart-healthy fats and, like all veggies, is cholesterol-free, yet it still provides your muscles with high-quality protein. Pair with veggies to add flavor plus a hefty dose of vitamins.
</p>
 

<li><b> Whole Grains with Protein</b></li>
<p>
Quinoa (pronounced “KEEN-wah”) is a mild grain with a pleasant chewy texture?and it’s higher in protein than most whole grains. Cooked in broth, it has even more flavor. Beans add extra protein and fiber to make a satisfying vegetarian salad.
</p>


<li><b>Legumes</b></li>
<p>
Legumes such as lentils, beans, and peas come packed with both healthy protein and carbohydrates. Lentils contain metabolism- boosting B vitamins as well as magnesium for bone health and iron for healthy red blood cells. 
</p>
 

<li><b>Skinless Chicken Breasts</b></li>
<p>
Skinless chicken breast is one of the leanest sources of protein. One 3-ounce serving has 94 calories, 20 grams of protein, and about 1 gram of fat. Quesadillas are easy to make with many fresh vegetables and some low-fat cheese. Use whole wheat flour tortillas to incorporate some additional whole grains.
</p>


<li><b>Fish Rich in Omega-3s</b></li>
<p>
Seafood is an ideal protein because it’s low in artery-clogging saturated fat. Plus, fatty fish rich in omega-3 fats can help lower triglyceride levels. There are so many kinds to choose from that there’s something to please everyone’s palate. Cod is a tender and mild fish and contains about 135 mg of omega-3s per 3-ounce serving. Cod also contains selenium, a mineral with antioxidant powers involved in enzyme function.
